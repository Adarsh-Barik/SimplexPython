# if should_print_tableau is True then tableau at each iteration will be printed

# Human Readable Configuration 
# This allows you to enter input in human readable format i.e.
# You can type objective functions and constraints algebraically as you normally do
# e.g. 
# min. x1 + x2
# subject to x1 + 3x2 <= 5
# 			 x1 - 2x2 <= 2

# problem_file
# problem_file is path to file where you have written the problem in human readable format

# assume_non_negative_variable
# If assume_non_negative_variable is True then you don't have to enter non-negativity constraints 
# However, if assume_non_negative_variable is False then you MUST enter non-negativity (or negativity) constraints
# in this case if non-negativity (or negativity) constraint for a variable is missing in problem_file then 
# it is assumed to be a free variable and treated as such

# Standard Form Configuration
# Alternatively, you can also input data in standard form
# All variables are assumed to be non-negative (as in the definition of standard form)

# coeff_matrix_file
# coeff_matrix_file contains data for coefficient matrix in standard form i.e. with coefficients of slack variables
# data should be typed as space delimited numbers
# e.g.
# 1 3 1 0
# 1 -2 0 1

# cost_coeff_file
# cost_coeff_file contains data for cost coefficients (coefficient in objective function)
# This should be a row vector
# data should be typed as space delimited numbers
# Make sure that this has 0 coefficient for slack variables (column dimension must match with standard coefficient matrix)
# e.g.
# 1 1 0 0

# b_file
# b_file contains data for RHS of constraints 
# This should be a column vector (row dimension must match with standard coefficient matrix)
# Make sure all values are non-negative (if they are not then you can multiply corresponding row with -1 and make it positive)
# e.g.
# 5
# 2

# is_min_problem 
# is_min_problem is True for minimization problem and False otherwise
